    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of COM2PME (the “App”).
      By accessing or using the App, you agree to these Terms.
      If you do not agree, do not use the App.
    </p>

    <h2>2. What the App Does</h2>
    <p>
      The App helps users connect their Meta (Facebook/Instagram) accounts to manage
      advertising workflows and related media processing through Meta APIs.
      Functionality may change over time.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Eligibility and Accounts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You must comply with Meta Platform Terms and all applicable laws.</li>
      <li>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your accounts and credentials.</li>
      <li>You must not share access tokens or attempt to access accounts you do not own or control.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the App for unlawful, misleading, deceptive, or fraudulent activity.</li>
      <li>Violate Meta policies, including advertising and data use policies.</li>
      <li>Attempt to interfere with, disrupt, or reverse engineer the App.</li>
      <li>Upload content you do not have the rights to use.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data and Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Your use of the App is also governed by our Privacy Policy.
      Please review it to understand how we collect and use data.

    </p>

    <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      The App integrates with Meta services (Facebook/Instagram). Your use of those services
      is subject to Meta’s terms and policies. We are not responsible for third-party services.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>
      The App is provided “as is” and “as available,” without warranties of any kind.
      We do not guarantee that the App will be uninterrupted, error-free, or that results
      (including ad approvals or performance) will meet your expectations.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      To the maximum extent permitted by law, COM2PME and its operators will not be liable for
      indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits,
      data, or goodwill, arising from your use of the App.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Termination</h2>
    <p>
      We may suspend or terminate access to the App at any time if we reasonably believe you have
      violated these Terms or applicable policies. You may stop using the App at any time.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>
      We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will update
      the effective date above. Continued use of the App after changes means you accept the updated Terms.
    </p>
